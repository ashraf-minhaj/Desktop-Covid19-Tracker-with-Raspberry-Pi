I had to do something to consistently inform everyone about the latest cases of COVID19. So, I made a digial desk display that shows the latest cases of COVID19 in real time. As this has a clock then I can put it in a place where everyone gathers or comes. They'll see the numbers add up, which will trigger awareness in them and hopefully everyone will be conscious.

Also as I am a maker and hobbyist, this turned out to be a good project to work on in this lock-down session.
